\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

There is existing work on statistical models where the observation data are not fully observable. In some literature, this is termed \emph{misclassified counts}. Misclassification happens when there are false positive counts or false negative counts (or possibly both). False positive counts, which can also be called the overcount, occur when the count includes events other than those of interest. False negative counts, which can also be called the undercount, occur when some of the events of interest are missed or omitted. Early work on the undercounting problem is quite common. Whittemore and Gong estimated cervical cancer rates by taking into account false negative data~\cite{whittemore1991}. Winkelmann and Zimmermann introduced a combination of a Poisson regression model with a logit model for under-counting, yielding the Poisson-Logistic (Pogit) model~\cite{winkelmann1993poisson}. They applied this to model the number of days employees were absent from a workplace. Dvorzak and Wagner adapted the Pogit model to use a small set of validation data, to provide information about the true counts~\cite{dvorzak2016}. They performed a Bayesian analysis of the Poisson-Logistic model and incorporate Bayesian variable selection to identify regressors with a non-zero effect and also to restrict parameters of the Poisson-Logistic model .

There is less prior work on the Poisson model for the case where the data may either be undercounted or overcounted~\cite{sposto1992, bratcher2002, bratcher2004, stamey2005}. Sposto et al. followed a frequentist approach to estimate both cancer and non-cancer death rates, assuming false negatives are possible on both sides of these counts~\cite{sposto1992}. In~\cite{bratcher2002}, Bratcher and Stamey used a Bayesian method to estimate Poisson rates in the presence of both undercounts and overcounts, borrowing the double sampling technique introduced in~\cite{Tenenbein1970}. They then extended their work to a fully Bayesian method for interval prediction of the unobservable actual count in future samples, given a current double sample~\cite{bratcher2004}. Stamey and Young~\cite{stamey2005} managed to obtained closed-form expressions for maximum likelihood estimators of the false negative rate, the false positive rate, and the Poisson rate for the model proposed in~\cite{bratcher2002}. The estimators are straightforward to calculate and to interpret in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of using unreliable counts.

Our work is most similar to that of Bratcher and Stamey~\cite{bratcher2002}. Both works aim to accurately estimate the arrival rate parameter of a single Poisson process. Bratcher and Stamey utilise double sampling to obtain the true count together with false positive and false negative counts. They estimate the  rate via MCMC since no closed form is found for $\lambda$, and the calculation of the full posterior is expensive. Double sampling assumes access to two counters with one always being a perfect counter. Our work goes beyond this since we consider multiple, potentially correlated, unreliable counters. To tackle the non-trivial density of the posterior, we propose three precise and tractable Bayesian estimators. This article also extends our prior work~\cite{jovan18a} by presenting three extensions of our original model, plus the application of these extensions to the problem of robot exploration.

% involved binomial and multinomial models~\cite{Bross1954,Chen1979,Hochberg1977,Tenenbein1970,Viana1993}. The first technique which was recorded to handle misclassification was double sampling. It was first introduced by Tenenbein to correct for misclassification of binomial data and obtain a maximum likelihood estimate~\cite{Tenenbein1970}. The double sampling approach utilizes two search techniques to retrieve relevant information: an expensive classification technique to obtain the true count along with the false positive count and false negative count from typically a small sample set, and a less-expensive classification technique only for error-prone counts on a larger sample set. The results of both counts are then combined to obtain estimators for the Poisson rate $\lambda$, and also for the misclassification parameters. The work of Tenenbein was then extended by Chen~\cite{Chen1979} and Hochberg~\cite{Hochberg1977} to correct misclassified counts in categorical and multinomial models to obtain maximum likelihood estimates. The double sampling technique was also extended to incorporate prior distributions in the binomial model and the posterior was obtained via Bayesian estimation~\cite{Viana1993}. Bekele extended the work of~\cite{Viana1993} by introducing a weighted prior scheme and allowing for several sources of information, including expert opinions~\cite{bekele1998binomial}.

% Different than the case of binomial and multinomial models, only a few studies are found working on the effect of partial observability of the data on the Poisson distribution. Many deal
