\section{The POPP Extensions}
\label{sec:popp_extensions}

Jovan et al., have shown that the POPP model is able to efficiently corrects miscounts made by multiple unreliable counting devices observing a single Poisson process \cite{jovan18a} . However, it was mentioned that the model is limited by two assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the degree of the unreliability of a sensor is precisely known, and
    \item counter failures are conditionally independent from one to another given the true count. 
\end{enumerate}
In this work, we propose three gradual extensions to the POPP model to tackle the aforementioned assumptions. The first extension (POPP-Beta) is built on top of the POPP model to tackle the first assumption. The second extension (C-POPP) modifies the POPP model to tackle the second assumption. The third extension (POPP-Dirichlet) is built on top of the C-POPP model to tackle both assumptions together.
