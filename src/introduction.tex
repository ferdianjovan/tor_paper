\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In recent years, autonomous mobile robots have been developed to assist humans with tasks in homes and offices~\cite{hawes2016strands}. In many of these tasks it is useful to be able to predict where humans are likely to be located. In dynamic environments, models of human behaviour must be learnt over time from observations~\cite{coppola2016learning,duckworth2016unsupervised}. Where these observations are made using sensors, both humans and current robot perception systems have some level of unreliability. This means that datasets of sensor observations typically contain systematic errors that lead to bias in subsequent statistical estimates. In this paper, we address the problem of unreliable sensors counting events by formulating a \textit{partially observable Poisson process} (POPP). As robot observations are often made \emph{jointly} by multiple sensors, we extend the POPP model to address observations from multiple sources, both correlated and uncorrelated.
% A standard fully observable Poisson process (FOPP) is introduced to distinct the POPP and its derivatives from it.

This article makes the following contributions. First, we introduce inference methods for the Poisson process which take into account the unreliability of either single or multiple observation sources. We also introduce the following variations of the POPP inspired by our work on mobile service robots. The first is the correlated POPP (C-POPP) which supports inference from multiple correlated sensors. The second variation is the POPP-Beta which deals with the unreliability of the observation model. We also combine C-POPP and POPP-Beta in the POPP-Dirichlet model that is able to deal with both correlated sensors and the unreliability of the observation model. We demonstrate the properties of POPP and its variants on numerical simulations and a real-world robotic dataset.
% 
Finally, we show the benefit of our POPP models by using the inference posterior to control exploration by a mobile robot over a 10 week deployment.

% We could cut the rest of the paragraph if we're should of space.
% Robot exploration arises from the fact that a mobile robot needs to observe human activities/behaviour in order to adapt to its environment. As the robot has a limit to its operational life, one would therefore like it to optimise the time it takes to build its models. 
% We contrast this with an exploration method based on the FOPP model. We show that the exploration method involving corrections to systematic errors doubles the number of human encounters the robot experiences. 

% We show variations of the exploration methods based on optimistic predictions from the resulting posteriors of the first contribution.

% The second contribution is the variation of exploration methods for a mobile robot based on optimistic predictions from the resulting posteriors of the first contribution. As any mobile robot in human-populated environment needs to learn human behaviour/activity, it must first explore where activities are likely to happened and observe them. One would like the robot to observe a sufficient amount of human activity, so as to learn the specific kinds of activity models. However, as a mobile robot can only be in one place at one time, its observations are spatially restricted. Moreover, the robot has a limit to its operational life. We would therefore like it to optimise the time it takes to build its models. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off problem \cite{wyatt1998exploration, 1413255, AUDIBERT20091876}, i.e. should the robot visit a familiar place, where it will probably observe two activities, or go to a new place, where it might observe many more but might see nothing? 

% is expected to work around and/or with humans, modelling human activities becomes a necessity. In any scenario where a robot learns about human activities, it must first explore where activities are likely to happened and observe them.

% Another important restriction in mobile robotics is that robot sensors are unreliable. Any solution must take into account the unreliability of sensors. We may also require that it do so for when multiple sensors are involved. This means that collected data which are used for learning typically contain systematic errors that lead to bias in the statistical estimates produced by the event detection processes.

% To allow the robot to observe a sufficient amount of human activity, so as to learn the specific kinds of activity models, putting an exploration to places with high number of activities becomes a mandatory action. There are several reasons behind this. First, a mobile robot can only be in one place at one time, so its observations are spatially restricted.   
% 
% The problem of this thesis can be loosely formulated as how to predict where many people are most likely to be and to go and observe them. Specifically, it requires the robot to go to where the aggregate level of human activity is highest. In addition, this thesis chooses to tackle the problem for the case where the robot runs for an extended period of time such days, or even weeks as it builds its models.
% A key challenge is for the robot to be able to recognise and react adequately to dynamic changes that happen in human-centered environments, especially when the changes are the result of human behaviour. The learning process for an autonomous mobile robot to adapt to its environment takes a big portion of its lifetime and it needs to deal with the huge volume of experiences accessible to it as it runs for longer periods of time. One advantage of all these is that these experiences contain potentially useful information that can help the robot to eventually adapt to its environment.

% Taken together, the challenges and benefits faced by an autonomous mobile robot motivate this thesis to create long-term understanding of temporal dynamics of human activities, along with the ability to exploit this understanding for a better adaptation of an autonomous mobile robot. The robot is expected to demonstrate its ability to predict future activities based on its statistical model. It is also expected to be able to detect anomalies as sequences of very low likelihood data.
