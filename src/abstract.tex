    % We present practical Bayesian inferences and exploration methods for count data collected by autonomous robots with unreliable sensors in human-populated environments. It addresses the problem of drawing incorrect inferences from unreliable count data which affects the effectiveness of robot exploration in maximizing its interaction with humans. Two contributions are presented in this paper: (1) A set of inference methods for a Poisson process which takes into account the unreliability of the robotic sensory systems used to count events is proposed, investigated, and empirically tested. The actual posterior distribution of such Poisson processes is estimated via two tractable approximations. Variations of these processes are presented, in which (i) sensors are uncorrelated, (ii) sensors are correlated, (iii) the unreliability of the observation model, when built from data, is accounted for. (2) Several exploration methods based on optimistic predictions from the resulting posteriors of contribution (1) are proposed, and empirically evaluated. They are assessed by the way they improve the number of human encounters the robot experiences. The results indicate that addressing the unreliable sensors improve human encounters by at least a factor of 2.   

	Robot exploration relies on accurate data to make a decision in exploring unknown environments. The data, where some of them arises in the form of counts, are prone to systematic error due to noisy sensors and unreliable perception algorithms. In this paper we present a collection of Bayesian estimators for the \emph{partially observable} variant of the Poisson process (POPP) which address this problem. The presented estimators deal with cases in which (i) the sensors are uncorrelated, (ii) the sensors are correlated, and (iii) the unreliability of the observation model, when built from data, is accounted for. We present an empirical analysis showing the benefit of correcting miscounts in both real and synthetic data. The resulting posterior is used to drive exploration of a mobile robot with unreliable sensors to maximize its exploration on its limited life time. 

    % The Poisson assumption is a popular choice when data arises in the form of counts. In many applications, such as in mobile robotics, such counts are prone to systematic error due to noisy sensors and perception algorithms. In this paper we present a collection of Bayesian estimators for the \emph{partially observable} variant of the Poisson process (POPP) which address this problem. The presented estimators deal with cases in which (i) the sensors are uncorrelated, (ii) the sensors are correlated, and (iii) the unreliability of the observation model, when built from data, is accounted for. The resulting posterior is used to drive exploration of a mobile robot with unreliable sensors. We also present an empirical analysis showing the benefit of correcting miscounts in both real and synthetic data, and robot exploration.
