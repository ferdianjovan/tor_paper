    The Poisson assumption is a popular choice when data arises in the form of counts. In many applications such as in mobile robotics, such counts are prone to a systematic error due to unreliable sensor algorithms and the data set that result can not be trusted. Only limited works have been done on the Poisson model when a full observability of the data is in question. We present practical Bayesian estimators in this paper for a partially observable Poisson process (POPP). Variations of these processes are presented, in which (i) sensors are uncorrelated, (ii) sensors are correlated, (iii) the unreliability of the observation model, when built from data, is accounted for. The actual posterior distributions are estimated via two tractable approximations, which we combined in a switching filter. The filter enables efficient and accurate estimation of the posterior. A detailed empirical analysis is performed on both simulated and real-world data, and an application of the resulting posterior to drive exploration of a mobile robot with unreliable sensors is presented.
